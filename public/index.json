Hey guys, this is Aryan and in this video, I will be walking you through my long form writing setup and help you optimize the physical process of writing.\nWhile writing long form text, such as while scripting videos, I love the experience of using both IA Writer and Ulysses. They\u0026rsquo;re some of the best designed apps I\u0026rsquo;ve ever used and offer an unparalleled editing experience. At the same time, I absolutely love using Logseq and all mynotetaking and outlining for videos happens there.\nA few months ago, I discovered a series of tweaks that made Logseq into a surprisingly polished and adept experience which has actually replaced iA writer, a dedicated writing app, in my workflow. (B: Roll)\nMy setup for this involves a few css tweaks and plugins. The first component of my system is the Logseq Focus Mode plugin. It\u0026rsquo;s an amazing plugin which contains multiple utilities to make the editing experience in Logseq nicer. You can install it from the marketplace.\nYou can access the plugin settings from this icon in the toolbar and configure the actions that you want to have occur. You can configure the plugin to enter focus mode on startup or rather, which is what I use, simply click the button to enter the focus mode. To configure focus mode, simply select the options you\u0026rsquo;d like to have. I\u0026rsquo;ve personally enabled hide page properties, line highlight, hide top bar which I actually submitted as a PR to the plugin. I\u0026rsquo;ve also enabled the options for hide left sidebar and right sidebar just for convenience sake.\nOn its own, you can already see the massive impact this can have, with the. entire screen already looking so much neater and conducive to writing.\nThis already looks very nice and clean, but there\u0026rsquo;s more that can still be done.\nDocument mode is an in built feature in Logseq which essentially allows you to treat the page as a regular Obsidian style document. You\u0026rsquo;ll notice that bullets disappear and also, importantly, that clicking enter doesn\u0026rsquo;t create a new block but rather a new line in the block you are already writing. This makes it so much easier to write longer paragraphs and in the case that you, like me, prefer splitting individual paragraphs into their own individual pages while still maintainging this even bulleted look, you can just use shift enter to create a new block.\nNeat!\nMakes for a great experience with the line highlighting from the previous step.\nThe next step are some css tweaks. The first is removing the help button on the bottom right corner. While this is normally pretty useful, you\u0026rsquo;re unlikely to be trying new features while writing a long form article and it therefore makes sense to hide it to reduce the clutter on the screen.\nThe next tweak is going to be removing the references section. While they are amazing features, when writing in a distraction free environment, they can often distract from what is supposed to be the main focus, the text that you are making. To hide this, type the following code into your custom.css file. Both CSS tweaks that I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned will be written down in the description.\nFinally comes themes. iA writer is one of my favorite distraction free writing apps and I love the way it\u0026rsquo;s interface is structured and designed. The amazing alexander rink has actually created an iA writer style theme for Logseq and this is the one I personally use for longer form writing sessions. Another one of my favorites for longer form writing in the Bear Theme, also by Alexander Rink.\nPlugin Ideas: Something that makes the experience even better\nThe Ultimate guide to Logseq namespaces\nHope this video was helpful and I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear more about your workflow and whether this video helped you down in the comments.

This is Aryan and in this video, I\u0026rsquo;ll be walking you through my workflow with namespaces and bring you the top tips and tricks on how to get the most out of them. This is meant to be a comprehensive video so it may be a bit long. I\u0026rsquo;ve added timestamps so you can skip around and refer back. Don\u0026rsquo;t miss the quick tips section though. I guarantee you\u0026rsquo;ll find something new or useful there\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start off with what are namespaces.\nI like to describe namespaces as essentially a way to create order in the chaos of tags. Generally, there is thought to be two primary structures in note taking apps, hierarchy/folder based or tags based.\nHierarchy based being apps like evernote and onenote where notes exist in folder are the primary means for organization is via folders. While tag based apps include those like Roam Research.\nBoth of these approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages, and most notetaking apps fall squarely in one of these categories. Logseq, is primarily a tag based app with most of the organization occurring using tags, I\u0026rsquo;ll link to a video here if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in learning more about it, but let\u0026rsquo;s get back to the topic at hand. Namespaces.\nSo like I mentioned, Namespaces are a way to create order in the chaos of tags. How exactly? Namespaces essentially allow you to make a page inherit from another page.\nThere are three cases where I\u0026rsquo;d use namespaces. First, to enable inheritance, Second is if you have two or more pages with similar names and finally, as a way to categorize and get a visual look at the category as well.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with inheritance. Let\u0026rsquo;s say I\u0026rsquo;ve got a page about a book called, say, The Daily Stoic which consists of all my highlights from that book. Now let\u0026rsquo;s say, I decide to watch Tiago Forte\u0026rsquo;s videos and realize that I should probably write a review or something to help me better understand the core message. Now, I might choose to add a section somewhere down below this page, but I quickly realize that this page is way too huge which can impact performance, and more importantly, takes ages to scroll down.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the solution here? To create another page strikes me as an great solution. But now another question comes to the fore. This content should still, fundamentally exist as part of the page. So now how do you handle this case? Of course you could name it something like \u0026ldquo;book review for daily stoic\u0026rdquo; and perhaps link to the main daily stoic page using a tag or something. But, namespaces are a very neat solution to this. To create a namespace, you simply create a blank new page. And just name it the name of the first page followed by a slash and then whatver you want to call that page.\nSo in this case, I\u0026rsquo;d name the page Daily Stoic/Review. Now, what\u0026rsquo;s powerful about this method is that when I go to the Daily Stoic page, there is now a section called hierarchy and over there, you can actually see the page in a tree like structure. Where at the top layer, there is the daily stoic and in a layer below, the daily stoic/review. We can probably go a step forwards and split the notes, into their own page as well, this block to page plugin is a lifesaver, and now we\u0026rsquo;ve essentially created a hierarchy. We start at a base daily stoic page, we may add a quick summary or review or something there that you would like to have from the hover tooltip, but also a notes page and review page that are all intrinsically linked.\nThis also allows you to essentially have multiple review pages while still keeping each review separate and connected to their respective books. This directly bridges into the next use case which is naming and differentiating repeated pages. Let me explain. Using the previous model, you essentially have a bunch of review pages, and these show up on the source page as just review, but they are, interestingly, linked to by the parent followed by the child or The Daily Stoic/Review. This means you can have multiple review pages in your databse, they all appear on the source as just review and they can be referred to and exist as separate pages. Cool.\nPerhaps the best example of this, is however, in programming notes. Normally when you\u0026rsquo;re learning new languages, a lot of the concepts are fundamentally the same, well at least in name. Functions for instance is a feature of probably every language you\u0026rsquo;ve learned. But how do you handle functions of different programming languages? The way I take programming notes involves me having a page for every single high level language or framework, i have pages for Swift and Javascript for instance. Now lets\u0026rsquo;s say I take a few notes on how to define a function in swift. So in this case, I would tag it with \u0026ldquo;swift/functions\u0026rdquo; and right the text under this block. Let\u0026rsquo;s say the next week, I\u0026rsquo;m learning python and specifically, I\u0026rsquo;m covering python functions.\nI would then create a page called python/functions. Let\u0026rsquo;s look back at what I\u0026rsquo;ve done. I\u0026rsquo;ve essentially covered two very similar programming concepts, but put them in their own pages based on a specific nuance. What\u0026rsquo;s even cooler is how when i go to the swift page, in the section for hierarchy, I\u0026rsquo;ve got literally data on every single topic that I\u0026rsquo;ve taken notes on, all organized into a nice and small list.\nThis may already sound a bit familiar to those who\u0026rsquo;ve used Evernote or Onenote or another notetaking tool in that vein, because this is essentially a list illustrating the hierarchy of a note, but combined with the power of Logseq can lead to lead to sort of a best of both worlds formulaas you can still use all your logseq features, still heavily lin kand ebed data in different places, but also be able to talk about the\nThe final primary use case is, once again similar to to the previous one and is really just as a way to get, at a quick glance, what a note is about. A common practice is prefixing videos with V:, Articles with D:, Courses with C: and so on. Since before I\u0026rsquo;ve used logseq, I\u0026rsquo;ve been prefixing my notes with this and this allows me, to at a glance see of what content type my notes on a video or something are.\nNow, this is an example of a workflow that can be supercharged with namespaces. By naming the page, perhaps b/atomic habits, what ends up happening is that\n Think of a namespace as an attribute you always want to be shown\n ","permalink":"http://example.org/pages/the-ultimate-guide-to-logseq-namespaces/","summary":"Script Namespaces are a killer feature in Logseq and can transform the way you work within it.
