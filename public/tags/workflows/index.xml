      <description>An area that has traditionally been described as one of Logseq&amp;rsquo;s weak points is long form writing, with the right setup however, you can get very good experience. Hey guys, this is Aryan and in this video, I will be walking you through my long form writing setup and help you optimize the physical process of writing.

This is Aryan and in this video, I&amp;rsquo;ll be walking you through my workflow with namespaces and bring you the top tips and tricks on how to get the most out of them. This is meant to be a comprehensive video so it may be a bit long. I&amp;rsquo;ve added timestamps so you can skip around and refer back.</description>
